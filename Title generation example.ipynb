The objective of this study was to investigate the muscle activity during cycling on three different bicycle designs, i.e., rigid frame (RF), suspension (SU) and sports (SP) using surface electromyography (sEMG). Twelve male volunteers participated in this study. sEMG signals were acquired bilaterally from extensor carpi radialis (ECR), trapezius medial (TM), latissimus dorsi medial (LDM) and erector spinae (ES), during 30\\u00a0min of cycling on each bicycle and after cycling. Time domain (RMS) and frequency domain (MPF) parameters were extracted from acquired sEMG signals. From the sEMG study, it was found that the fatigue in right LDM and ES were significantly (p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05) higher in SP bicycle.

All participants in society are required to follow specific regulations and laws. An autonomous system cannot be an exception. Inevitably an autonomous system will find itself in a situation in which it needs to not only choose to obey a rule or not, but also make a complex ethical decision. However, there exists no obvious way to implement the human understanding of ethical behaviour in computers. Even if we enable autonomous systems to distinguish between more and less ethical alternatives, how can we be sure that they would choose right? We consider autonomous systems with a hybrid architecture in which the highest level of reasoning is executed by a rational (BDI) agent. For such a system, formal verification has been used successfully to prove that specific rules of behaviour are observed when making decisions. We propose a theoretical framework for ethical plan selection that can be formally verified. We implement a rational agent that incorporates a given ethical policy in its plan selection and show that we can formally verify that the agent chooses to execute, to the best of its beliefs, the most ethical available plan.\"\n","\n","print(tg.generate_title_on_spot(highlights, abstract))  # true title: Formal verification of ethical choices in autonomous systems"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Example with a BIO paper"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-12T11:42:51.532387Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-12T11:42:51.531967Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-12T11:43:55.283304Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-12T11:43:55.282096Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-12T11:42:51.532351Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["tg = TitleGenerator(model_name=\"pietrocagnasso/bart-paper-titles-bio\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-12T11:44:38.228247Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-12T11:44:38.227740Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-12T11:44:39.118448Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-12T11:44:39.117184Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-12T11:44:38.228206Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Molecular characterization of calcifying fibrous tumor and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor\n"]}],"source":["highlights = [\"It has been hypothesized that calcifying fibrous tumoris the late regressive stage of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.\",\n","             \"By genome-wide methylation assay we could provide evidence that these lesions are a spectrum of one entity\",\n","             \"The well-known fusion genes ALK, ROS1 and RET, a hallmark of IMT, were not find in our CFT.\"]\n","abstract = \"Based on histological findings, calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT) may be a late (burned out) stage of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). This concept, however, has not been proven by molecular means. Five CFTs were analyzed for IMT-related rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and RET using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Additionally, genome-wide methylation patterns were investigated and compared with IMT (n = 7), leiomyoma (n = 7), angioleiomyoma (n = 9), myopericytoma (n = 7) and reactive soft tissue lesions (n = 10) using unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis and t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. CFT patients, 4 females and 1 male, had a median age of 20 years ranging from 7 to 43 years. Two patients were younger than 18 years old. The tumors originated in the abdomen (n = 4) and axilla (n = 1). Histologically, all lesions were (multi) nodular and hypocellular consisting of bland looking (myo)fibroblasts embedded in a collagenous matrix with calcifications. FISH analysis brought up negative results for ALK, RET and ROS1 rearrangements. However, genome-wide methylation analysis revealed overlapping methylation patterns of CFT and IMT forming a distinct homogeneous methylation cluster with exception of one case clustering with myopericytoma/angioleiomyoma. In conclusion, DNA methylation profiling supports the concept that CFT and IMT represent both ends of a spectrum of one entity with CFT being the burn out stage of IMT.,Molecular characterization of calcifying fibrous tumor and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor\"\n","\n","print(tg.generate_title_on_spot(highlights, abstract))  # true title: Calcifying fibrous tumor and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor are epigenetically related: A comparative genome-wide methylation study"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Example on a general paper (AI)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-12T11:45:29.938451Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-12T11:45:29.938020Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-12T11:46:23.893178Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-12T11:46:23.892038Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-12T11:45:29.938414Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["tg = TitleGenerator(model_name=\"pietrocagnasso/bart-paper-titles\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-12T11:46:50.533213Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-12T11:46:50.532815Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-12T11:46:50.989320Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-12T11:46:50.988074Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-12T11:46:50.533179Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["A Transformer-based Highlights Extractor\n"]}],"source":["highlights = [\"We propose a novel Transformer-based Highlights Extractor (THExt, in short).\",\n","             \"We achieve performance superior to state-of-the-art highlights extraction methods on three benchmark datasets.\"]\n","abstract = \"Highlights are short sentences used to annotate scientific papers.

This paper leverages the attention mechanism adopted in transformer models to improve the accuracy of sentence relevance estimation. Unlike existing approaches, it relies on the end-to-end training of a deep regression model.
