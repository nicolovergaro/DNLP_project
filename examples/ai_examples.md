# [Formal verification of ethical choices in autonomous systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889015003000)
- We propose a method for, and have implemented a working prototype of, an ethical extension to a rational agent governing an unmanned aircraft (UA).
- Model checking has been used in  [20] for providing formal evidence for the certification of autonomous unmanned aircraft.
- The main contribution of our paper is a verifiable ethical decision-making framework that implements a specified ethical decision policy.


# [A bilevel approach to enhance prefixed traffic signal optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197619301253)
- The main objective of this section is to state the optimization models for the determination of TODs based on the time-domain-constrained data-clustering problem.
- The time-domain-constrained data clustering problem tackles a clustering problem in which data are labelled with the time where they were gathered.
- The oriented-problem method has an interpretation which allows its easy application and achieves fair values.


# [Aleatoric uncertainty estimation with test-time augmentation for medical image segmentation with convolutional neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231219301961)
- First, we propose a theoretical formulation of test-time augmentation for deep learning.
- Second, with the proposed formulation of test-time augmentation, we propose a general aleatoric uncertainty estimation for medical image segmentation, where the uncertainty comes from not only image noise but also spatial transformations.
- However, previous works have rarely demonstrated uncertainty estimation for deep CNN-based medical image segmentation.


# [A semantic approach for text clustering using WordNet and lexical chains](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417414006472)
- (1) We propose a modified similarity measure based on WordNet for word sense disambiguation.
- Section 3 presents a modified similarity measure based on WordNet for word sense disambiguation.
- A modified WordNet-based semantic similarity measure is proposed for word sense disambiguation, and lexical chains are employed to extract core semantic features that express the topic of documents.


# [Compliance monitoring in business processes: Functionalities, application, and tool-support](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437915000459)
- This paper presents a framework for the systematic comparison of compliance monitoring approaches in the business process management area.
- RQ2: What are functionalities that are essential for compliance monitoring approaches in business processes?
- The goal of this paper is to define a framework for Compliance Monitoring Functionalities (CMF) that enables the systematic comparison of existing and new approaches for monitoring compliance rules over business processes during runtime.


# [Mind the gap: Impact on learnability of user interface design of authoring tools for teachers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581916300453)
- We were thus motivated to design and implement DEDOS-Editor, a novel authoring tool meant to provide a consistent design metaphor to smooth the learning curve for teachers.
- In addition, we measured whether reuse improves the learning curve of DEDOS-Editor.
- The experiment compares DEDOS-Editor with an authoring tool that can be seen as a fair example of those available.


# [Data mining for fuzzy diagnosis systems in LTE networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417415003590)
- In this study, a novel supervised data driven learning algorithm for wireless networks based on the WM (Wang & Mendel, 1992) method is described.
- In Section 3.2 an algorithm for extracting the knowledge from a set of solved troubleshooting cases is proposed.
- A novel DM algorithm for obtaining the RB of FLCs from a set of solved cases for mobile network troubleshooting has been presented.


# [Approaches to measuring inconsistency for stratified knowledge bases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X13002867)
- In Section 3 we propose the multi-section inconsistency measure and its two instances for stratified knowledge bases.
- In Section 4 we propose preference-based inconsistency measures for stratified knowledge bases.
- To address these issues, we propose two approaches to measuring inconsistency for stratified knowledge bases in this paper.


# [Pre-gait analysis using optimal parameters for a walking machine tool based on a free-leg hexapod structure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889015000834)
- To address this need, this paper reports on a theoretical analysis of a Walking free-leg Hexapod structure (WalkingHex) that represents a key step forward from the previously reported Free-leg Hexapod configuration.
- This paper presents a gait methodology based on stability margin criteria and a torque analysis, noting that the WalkingHex, having telescopic legs, is capable of varying the pose and translation of the upper platform, which can be taken into consideration to improve the stability margin and actuation torque of the system.
- Fig. 17 shows that the rotation of the hexapod can have a significant impact on the stability margin and torque in the system, even when the system is on a flat plane ( α = 0 ) .


# [Stock market prediction using Firefly algorithm with evolutionary framework optimized feature reduction for OSELM method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590188519300162)
- Both statistical based and optimized based feature reduction methods are employed to the dataset.
- An empirical comparison is established among the performance of prediction models using both statistical and optimized feature reduction techniques.
- An empirical comparison is carried among all the prediction models for all types of feature reduction techniques using all the datasets.
