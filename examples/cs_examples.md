# [Muscle fatigue based evaluation of bicycle design](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687013000859)
- Changes in muscle activity during on-road cycling were quantified each time a participant rode a bicycle.
- This study used percentage deviation in MPF and RMS to significantly differentiate the muscle activity before and after 30 min of cycling; slope of MPF and RMS to significantly evaluate the fatigue rate during on-road cycling on the three different bicycle designs.
- These significant differences among the three bicycle designs have been demonstrated by means of MVC test before and after cycling and real-time monitoring of muscle activity during on-road cycling.


# [Optimal protruding node length of bicycle seats determined using cycling postures and subjective ratings](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687014000271)
- In summary, the protruding node length (PNL) is a crucial difference among various bicycle seats.
- No previous study has systematically examined the effects of PNL on cycling posture, body discomfort, and cycling stability.
- Fig. 4 shows that differences in cycling stability between the two handle types.


# [A socio-technical systems approach to studying interruptions: Understanding the interrupter's perspective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687013001956)
- Second, to determine interruptibility, nurses conduct a cost-benefit assessment to distinguish value-added interruptions from non-valued added interruptions when deciding whether to interrupt.
- The former methods are most preferred to reduce non-value added interruptions.
- It is quite apparent that very often, prior to interrupting, nurses complete quick cost-benefit assessments to determine whether another nurse is interruptible and the interruption is value-added versus non-value added.


# [Do the coach and athlete have the same «picture» of the situation? Distributed Situation Awareness in an elite sport context](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687013002032)
- The investigation showed that the schemata used to ‘frame’ the information elements were different, but compatible, between athlete and coach.
- They might also explain how some information elements were different between the athlete and coach and some others were compatible.
- Results showed that technical elements were the category most frequently reported and compatible between the athlete's and coach's SA.


# [Effects of slanted ergonomic mice on task performance and subjective responses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687013001282)
- Furthermore, their subjective preference results showed that most of the participants preferred the conventional mouse more than the vertical mouse.
- The present study investigated the effects of two slanted ergonomic mice (slant angle: 30° and 50°) on task performance and subjective responses in comparison with a conventional mouse (slant angle: 0°).
- The participants didn't prefer to the slanted mice in comparison with the CM.


# [Management of personal safety risk for lever operation in mechanical railway signal boxes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687013000732)
- This paper has addressed the question of the risks of operating levers in mechanical lever frame rail signal boxes from two perspectives.
- This paper has reported the development of a programme to manage the risks of injury to rail signallers using large levers in mechanical signalling boxes for the operation of signals and points.
- Examination of the lever weight data across the second pre-screened sample and the two phases of biomechanical computer modelling established 100 kg as an acceptable action level for a feasible risk management programme.


# [Learning effects in the lane change task (LCT) – Realistic secondary tasks and transfer of learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687013001804)
- One of these easy-to-use tools is the lane change task (LCT; Mattes, 2003).
- We conducted two experiments to find out if the learning effects found in previous studies also occur when combining the LCT with a realistic secondary task, and if so, if there is a transfer of learning between different dual task combinations.
- In a first experiment, we sought to find evidence that the learning effects found in previous studies also occur when combining the LCT with a realistic secondary task.


# [Reliability and validity of the Home Care STAT (Safety Task Assessment Tool)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687014000258)
- Home care workers (HCWs) are a priority population for ergonomic assessment and intervention.
- The aim of the current research was to evaluate the Home Care STAT as an ergonomic self-assessment tool for HCWs.
- Results confirm that HCWs are a population in need of health and safety interventions, and that the STAT is an acceptably reliable and valid tool for safety self-assessment in home care.


# [Context adaptable driver information – Or, what do whom need and want when?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687013002706)
- The CFM can be utilized in the design of new context adaptive driver information interfaces.
- Not surprisingly, the results indicate that drivers want or need different functions in different contexts.
- The results can be used as a guideline for design of context adaptive driver information systems or for optimization of display space.


# [Human interaction with policy flight simulators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687013000604)
- Computational modeling Interactive visualization Policy flight simulators
- This article shows how policy flight simulators can allow key stakeholders to “drive the future” before they commit to it.
- This article has discussed policy flight simulators that are designed for the purpose of exploring alternative management policies at levels ranging from individual organizations to national strategy.
