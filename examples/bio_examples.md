# [Calcifying fibrous tumor and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor are epigenetically related: A comparative genome-wide methylation study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1092913419301819)
- The most convincing argument that CFT and IMT form a spectrum with CFT being the burned out end we found by methylation profiling showing overlapping methylation patterns.
- This study investigated the relation between CFT and IMT by comparing the genome-wide methylation patterns of both CFT and IMT alongside myopericytoma, angioleiomyoma, leiomyoma and reactive soft tissue lesions.
- Leiomyoma and reactive lesions clustered separately.


# [Reparative effects of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in young and aged/co-morbid rodents after cerebral ischemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159116305153)
- Our findings demonstrate that subcutaneous administration of IL-1Ra is neuroprotective in young and aged animals with multiple risk factors for stroke and increases post-stroke neurogenesis.
- Delayed administration of IL-1Ra resulted in a reduced infarct volume, a preservation of BBB integrity and improvements in some functional outcomes.
- In conclusion, we demonstrate that IL-1Ra protects against ischemic brain injury and improves functional recovery in aged/co-morbid animals when administered peripherally at delayed time points.


# [A Potent and Specific CD38 Inhibitor Ameliorates Age-Related Metabolic Dysfunction by Reversing Tissue NAD+ Decline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413118301943)
- Our study reveals CD38 as a potential pharmacological target to reverse age-related NAD+ decline.
- 78c reverses age-related NAD+ decline and ameliorates several metabolic, structural, and molecular features of aging in chronologically aged and progeroid mice.
- In conclusion, our study establishes CD38 as a viable pharmacological target for age-related metabolic decline by reversing the decrease in NAD+ associated with aging.


# [Increased of the hepatocytes and splenocytes apoptosis accompanies clinical improvement and higher survival in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and treated with highly diluted Lycopodium clavatum](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401016307872)
- In this study with highly diluted compounds, for the first time, it was possible showing the increased apoptosis, production of Th1 cytokines, clinical improvement and higher survival in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi.
- Detection of cells undergoing apoptosis on the eighth day of infection with T. cruzi in mice treated with different highly diluted compounds is described in Fig. 5 .
- Highly diluted compounds are capable of regulating the immune system, preserving organs [59] and destroying cells with alterations [60].


# [Post-poliomyelitis syndrome as a possible viral disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971215001058)
- Monoclonal antibodies have recently been added to the anti-polio armamentarium.
- Health issues for ageing polio survivors and young polio survivors differ.
- Anti-poliovirus immunity is protective and life-long.


# [Antibacterial effector/immunity systems: it's just the tip of the iceberg](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527413002178)
- Thus, Gram-positive bacteria survive bacteriocin release, whereas most Gram-negative bacteria undergo autolysis for effector protein release [13,14].
- ORFs encoding for Tle proteins were identified in many other Gram-negative bacteria.
- In contrast, the T1SS, T2SS, T3SS, T5SS, and the recently discovered T6SS have only been identified in the genome of Gram-negative bacteria, whereas the T7SS has been exclusively found in Gram-positive Mycobacteria.


# [The making and function of CAR cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247819301877)
- One of the clear benefits of CAR cell therapy is its independence of MHC restriction.
- Nevertheless, future developments in the field of CAR cell therapy could make the therapy safe even for this application.
- Effective CAR cell activation not only depends on the appropriate function of the intracellular activation domains but also on proper recognition of the targeted antigen.


# [Physical behavior and associations with health outcomes in operable NSCLC patients: A prospective study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169500218302964)
- Following this, the primary objective of this study was to characterize daily physical behavior of operable NSCLC patients, from preoperative to six months postoperative using accelerometry.
- So far, pre- to postoperative patterns of physical behavior of operable NSCLC patients and their relation to health and PROMs are lacking from literature.
- Patients who were more active in the first month following surgery reported better health outcomes six months postoperative.


# [Detecting frontotemporal dementia syndromes using MRI biomarkers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158219300610)
- The first MRI biomarker, the anterior vs. posterior index (API), reflects the fact that frontal and temporal brain regions are affected in FTD, whereas posterior regions are relatively preserved.
- ASI showed highest performance for detecting the two PPA subtypes, whereas TPL was specific for detection of svPPA.
- Both ASI and TPL perform better than API with regards to separation of the FTD subtypes svPPA and nfvPPA.


# [Povidone iodine in wound healing: A review of current concepts and practices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919117305368)
- The benefits of povidone iodine in chronic wound healing, as in burn wounds [23], may extend beyond its antimicrobial properties [74].
- The authors' clinical experience with the use of povidone iodine in patients with burn wounds is detailed in Table 5 .
- The aim of this article is to clarify the current role and use of povidone iodine in wound healing from both diverse regional and specialist's perspectives.
